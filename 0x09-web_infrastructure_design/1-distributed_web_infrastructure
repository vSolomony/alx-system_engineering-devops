Distributed Web Infrastructure Design
Server Infrastructure:
Components:
3 Servers
1 Web Server (Nginx)
1 Application Server
1 Load Balancer (HAproxy)
1 Application Code Base
1 Database (MySQL)
User Interaction:
User types www.foobar.com in the browser.
DNS resolves www.foobar.com to the load balancer's IP.
Load balancer distributes the request to one of the application servers.
Explanation of Components:
Additional Elements and Their Purposes:
Load Balancer (HAproxy):
Balances traffic among multiple servers to improve performance and ensure high availability.
Additional Server:
Enhances system redundancy and allows for horizontal scaling.
Primary-Replica Database Cluster:
Improves database reliability and provides read scalability.
Distribution Algorithm:
Load Balancer Algorithm:
Round Robin - Distributes requests equally among servers.
Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:
Active-Active Setup:
All servers actively handle requests simultaneously.
Active-Passive Setup:
Only one server handles requests actively; others act as backups, becoming active only if the primary fails.
Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster:
How it Works:
Primary node accepts write operations, replicating data to replica nodes.
Difference Between Primary and Replica:
Primary handles write operations; replicas handle read operations, improving read scalability.
Issues with this Infrastructure:
Single Points of Failure (SPOF):
Load balancer, web server, and database could be potential SPOFs.
Security Issues:
Lack of firewall and HTTPS exposes the infrastructure to security threats.
No Monitoring:
Absence of monitoring tools may lead to difficulties in identifying and resolving issues.
Additional Explanations:
Distribution Algorithm Details:
Briefly explain how Round Robin works in the context of the load balancer.
Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Clarification:
Provide a concise comparison highlighting when each setup is preferred.
Database Cluster Benefits:
Emphasize the advantages of a Primary-Replica cluster for database reliability.
