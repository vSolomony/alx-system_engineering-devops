Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure Design
Server Infrastructure:
Components:
3 Servers
1 Web Server (Nginx)
1 Application Server
1 Load Balancer (HAproxy)
1 Application Code Base
1 Database (MySQL)
Additional Elements:
3 Firewalls
1 SSL Certificate for HTTPS
3 Monitoring Clients (Data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)
Explanation of Components:
Firewalls:
Adds a layer of security by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on defined security rules.
SSL Certificate (HTTPS):
Encrypts data in transit, ensuring secure communication between users and the server.
Monitoring Clients:
Collects data on system performance, logs, and security events for analysis and troubleshooting.
Why These Additions:
Firewalls for Security:
Protects against unauthorized access, ensuring only valid traffic reaches the servers.
HTTPS for Secure Communication:
Guards against eavesdropping and data tampering during transit.
Monitoring for Insights:
Provides insights into system performance, identifies issues, and aids in proactive maintenance.
Monitoring Tool Data Collection:
Data Collection Mechanism:
Monitoring clients collect data on metrics, logs, and events, forwarding them to the monitoring tool (Sumologic).
Monitoring Web Server QPS:
Steps to Monitor QPS:
Configure the monitoring tool to capture and analyze the query per second (QPS) metric from the web server logs.
Issues with this Infrastructure:
Terminating SSL at Load Balancer Level:
Leaves the internal network vulnerable to potential attacks as the decrypted traffic is passed through.
Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:
Creates a single point of failure for write operations, impacting system availability.
Identical Components on Servers:
Uniformity might lead to scalability issues and lack of diversity for fault tolerance.
Additional Explanations:
Firewall Configuration:

Briefly explain the need for firewall rules based on the principle of least privilege.
SSL Termination Concerns:

Elaborate on the risks associated with terminating SSL at the load balancer level.
Diversity in Server Components:

Highlight the importance of diverse components for better fault tolerance.
