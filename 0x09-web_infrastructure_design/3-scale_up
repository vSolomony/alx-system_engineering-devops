Scaling Up Web Infrastructure Design
Readme
Application Server vs. Web Server

Server Infrastructure:

Components:
2 Servers (1 additional)
1 Load Balancer (HAproxy) configured as a cluster
1 Web Server (Nginx) on its own server
1 Application Server on its own server
1 Database (MySQL)
Explanation of Components:

Additional Server:

Purpose:
Enhances system scalability and allows for the separation of concerns.
Reasoning:
Distributes the load and improves fault tolerance.
Load Balancer Cluster:

Purpose:
Ensures high availability and load distribution.
Reasoning:
Clustering ensures redundancy, preventing a single point of failure.
Split Components on Separate Servers:

Web Server on its own:
Serves static content and handles client requests.
Application Server on its own:
Executes dynamic application logic.
Database:
Stores and retrieves data.
Reasoning:
Isolates components for better scalability, maintenance, and resource utilization.
Issues with this Infrastructure:

Complexity:
Increased complexity due to the introduction of multiple servers.
Resource Allocation:
Ensuring proper resource allocation among servers might be challenging.
